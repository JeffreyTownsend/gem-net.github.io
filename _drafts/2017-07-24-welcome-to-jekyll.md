With Jekyll, the whole website auto-regenerates when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_hi(name)
  print("Hi, {}".format(name))

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
