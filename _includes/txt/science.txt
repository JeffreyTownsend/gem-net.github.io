**C-GEM** seeks to solve a “Holy Grail” level problem in modern science: the inability to prepare polymers whose monomers are defined with protein-like control. Sequence-defined polymers possess extraordinary potential for information storage, anti-counterfeiting, drug delivery, remediation, even drug discovery, and much more, but strategies to prepare them are barely in their infancy.

C-GEM will synthesize sequence-defined chemical polymers by repurposing the *E. coli* translational apparatus to promote bond-forming reactions between monomers that are not a-amino acids, but instead the building blocks for aramids, polyolefins, polyurethanes, even polyketide precursors.

This goal demands orthogonal enzymes that acylate orthogonal tRNAs with each monomer, efficiently and *in vivo*; orthogonal ribosomes that accept these tRNAs as substrates and elongate the products; genomically recoded organisms with multiple open codons to enable mRNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers; and high-resolution structural data to deepen understanding and inform design.

`Phase I` efforts will develop the multi-disciplinary tools and technologies to accomplish this goal. In `Phase II`, an expanded team of chemists, biologists, engineers, computational and materials scientists, and industrial partners will expand these efforts to biosynthesize, characterize, and interrogate multiple classes of truly exotic chemical polymers, containing 3 or more distinct monomers per class—products that can only be generated in recoded organisms whose ribosomes support novel chemistries.

**Sequence-defined chemical polymers are the materials of tomorrow.**
