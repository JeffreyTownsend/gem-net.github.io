The mission of the *Center for Genetically Encoded Materials* (**C-GEM**) is to generate a fundamentally new form of matter: sequence-defined chemical polymers. To achieve this goal, we are re-engineering the natural translation machine---the ribosome and its associated protein and nucleic acid factors---into a new machine that biosynthesizes chemical polymers with precisely defined sequence and dispersity. C-GEMâ€™s scientific goals will establish a transformative field of chemistry, foster innovation at the chemistry-biology-materials frontier, and captivate scientists and non-scientists alike. A diverse set of education and participation programs will integrate research with training, establish a diverse chemical workforce, and improve communication with the public. To catalyze these efforts, C-GEM will implement a spectacular data management system, GEM-NET, to promote data sharing within and outside the team, and with industry, the NSF, and the public.
